# Hi, I'm Angela 👋

I'm a technical recruiter focused on compilers, runtimes, kernel engineering, and HPC.  
I translate complex technical work into clear hiring signals and meaningful conversations, and I build sourcing systems that help frontier AI teams hire exceptional engineers.

### 🔍 What I Do
- Source through OSS ecosystems (MLIR, LLVM, TVM, Triton, XLA, Linux Kernel, gem5)
- Build repeatable, evidence-based sourcing frameworks for deep technical roles
- Partner closely with engineering to align on signals, depth, and role clarity
- Create talent maps, outreach libraries, and sourcing playbooks for hard-to-fill roles

### 🧠 Areas I Specialise In
- **Compiler engineering** (MLIR, LLVM, TVM, Triton, XLA)
- **Runtime engineering** (CUDA, ROCm, scheduling, memory systems)
- **Kernel & systems** (Linux kernel, drivers, GPU stack)
- **Modelling & simulation** (gem5, QEMU, HPC)
- **Developer experience & tooling** (Bazel, CMake, Rust tooling)

### 🛠 How I Work
I prioritise:
- Signal over volume  
- OSS contributions over job titles  
- Technical depth over buzzwords  
- Respectful, personalised outreach over automation  

### 📍 Currently
Building high-impact engineering teams at **Fractile AI**.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect
